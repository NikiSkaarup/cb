# Priority Units

This list should be done top down or Cavalry then top down.

* Counter Cavalry (*Pick one*)
    * **Halberdier Sergeants** (*High damage units with Brace weapon, good combined with Imperial Spear Guard*)
    * **Imperial Pike Guards** (*Strong units with slow advance*)
        * **Iron Reapers** (*Strong melee units with blunt damage, can charge shield units and annihilate them*)
* Shield units (*Pick one*)
    * **Spear Sergeants** (*Required for **Monastic Knights**, so if you are taking those over Winged Huzzars do these first*)
    * **Imperial Spear Guard** (*Probably the strongest tank units, but weak against cavalry, placing halberdiers or pikemen on top of them fixes that weakness*)
* Muskets (*Pick one*)
    * **Tercio Arquebusiers** (*Can be a really good melee unit if needed*)
    * **Imperial Arquebusiers** (*Can get constant firing*)
* Cavalry Units (*Pick one*)
    * **Monastic Knights** (*These are cheaper, and you get useful units for siege battles, while getting them*)
    * **Winged Huzzars** (*Overpowered, but expensive costs north of 91k honor*)
* Bow / Crossbow (*Pick one*)
    * **Rattan Marksman** (*Good ranged unit, with loads of over time damage, but has a large damage fall off on long range*)
        * **Rattan Rangers** (*Probably the best Hero killing units, in the game*)
    * **Imperial Archers** (*High armor penetration, but no over time damage*)
