# Priority Units

* Counter Cavalry (*Pick one*)
    * Halberdier Sergeants (*High damage units with Brace weapon, good combined with Imperial Spear Guard*)
    * Imperial Pike Guards (*Strong units with slow advance*)
        * Iron Reapers (*Strong melee units with blunt damage, can charge shield units and annihilate them*)
* Imperial Spear Guard (*Probably the strongest tank units, but weak against cavalry, placing halberdiers or pikemen on top of them fixes that weakness*)
* Rattan Marksman (*Good ranged unit, but has a large damage fall off on long range*) -> Rattan Rangers (*Hero killers*)
* Muskets (*Pick one*)
    * Tercio Arquebusiers
    * Imperial Arquebusiers (*Constant firing*)
* Cavalry Units (*Pick one*)
    * Winged Huzzars (*Overpowered, but expensive costs north of 91k honor*)
    * Monastic Knights (*These are cheaper, and you get useful units for siege battles, while getting them*)
