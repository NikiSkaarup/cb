# Rattan Armour

> Rattan armour is cheap, lightweight, and resistant to slashing, but is vulnerable to incendiary weapons

Takes extra damage from fire attacks like [**Rattan Marksmen**](../units/rattan-army/rattan-marksmen.md) with their fire dart veterancy and [**Incendiary Archers**](../units/ranged-infantry/incendiary-archers.md) with their fire arrow ability.
